 * Represents an Asset with a FQN which is a fully-qualified identifier and the location.

 * FQN is formed by using the plugin properties that together identifies an asset. For e.g. in case of DB plugins,
 * the plugin can be of the form {dbType}.{host}: {port}.{database}.{schema}.
 * If location is not known for an asset, it is set to "unknown" by default.
