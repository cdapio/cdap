Continuuity (tm) Reactor Development Kit - 2.0.0

Copyright 2012-2013 Continuuity,Inc. All Rights Reserved.
================================================================================
Continuuity Reactor Development Kit  includes a Local Reactor: a fully functioning 
single node edition of the Continuuity Reactor runtime. You can use this edition to
write, debug and test your Big Data applications, before deploying them to a
remote staging or production Reactor.

Installation
============
To install and use Reactor and the included examples there are a few simple
prerequisites:

  1. JDK 6 (required to run Reactor, note: $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js 0.8.16+ (required to run the Reactor Dashboard)
  3. Ant 1.8+ (required to build the example applications)

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you should unzip the Developer Suite
distribution to a suitable directory. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects
  %> unzip /tmp/continuuity-reactor-development-kit-2.0.0.zip

You are now ready to start Reactor. Do so by running the 'continuuity-reactor' 
script in the $CONTINUUITY/bin folder. E.g.

  %> cd ~/Projects/continuuity-reactor-development-kit-2.0.0
  %> bin/continuuity-reactor start
  %> bin/run-example SentimentAnalysis

Further Information
===================
Documentation covering the core concepts for developing applications for
the Reactor platform can be found in Continuuity-Reactor-Developer-Guide-v2.0.0.pdf
