Cask Data Application Platform Software Development Kit - ${project.version}
================================================================================

The Cask Data Application Platform (Cask DAP or CDAP) Development Kit includes a Local
DAP: a fully functioning single-node edition of the Cask DAP runtime. You can use this
edition to write, debug and test your Big Data applications, before deploying them to a
remote staging or production DAP.


Installation
============

To install and use Cask DAP and the included examples there are a few simple
prerequisites:

  1. JDK 6 or JDK 7 (required to run CDAP, note: $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js 0.8.16+ (required to run the CDAP Console)
  3. Apache Maven 3.0+ (required to build the example applications)

Once you have installed the prerequisites, unzip the SDK to a suitable directory:

  %> cd <path to SDK>
  %> unzip /tmp/cdap-sdk-${project.version}.zip


Starting Cask DAP
=================

You are now ready to start CDAP. Do so by running the 'cdap' 
script in the $CDAP/bin folder:

  %> cd ~/<path to SDK>/cdap-sdk-${project.version}
  %> ./bin/cdap.sh start
  
or on Windows:
  
  > cd ~\<path to SDK>\cdap-sdk-${project.version}
  > bin\cdap.bat start
