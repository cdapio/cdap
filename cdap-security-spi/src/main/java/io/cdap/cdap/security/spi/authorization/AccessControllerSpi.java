/**
 * Interface for managing {@link Principal principals'} authorization for {@link Permission
 * permissions} on {@link EntityId CDAP entities}. Authorization extensions must implement this
 * interface to delegate authorization to appropriate authorization back-ends. The contract with
 * Authorization extensions is as below:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Authorization is enabled setting the parameter {@code security.authorization.enabled} to true in
 *   {@code cdap-site.xml}.</li>
 *   <li>The path to the extension jar bundled with all its dependencies must be specified by
 *   {@code security.authorization.extension.jar.path} in cdap-site.xml</li>
 *   <li>The extension jar must contain a class that implements {@link AccessControllerSpi}. This class must be
 *   specified as the {@link Attributes.Name#MAIN_CLASS} in the extension jar's manifest file.</li>
 *   <li>The contract with the class that implements {@link AccessControllerSpi} is that it must have a default
 *   constructor.</li>
 *   <li>{@link AccessControllerSpi} also provides lifecycle methods for extensions.
 *   {@link #initialize(AuthorizationContext)} can be used to perform initialization tasks. This method provides
 *   an {@link AuthorizationContext} which gives extensions access to CDAP entities for operations like creating
 *   and accessing datasets, accessing datasets in transactions, etc. It also provides access to
 *   {@link Properties extension properties} via the {@link AuthorizationContext#getExtensionProperties()} method.
 *   The {@link Properties} object returned form this method is populated with all configuration settings from
 *   {@code cdap-site.xml} that have keys with the prefix {@code security.authorization.extension.config}.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link #destroy()} method can be used to perform cleanup tasks.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This is newer version of {@link AccessController}
