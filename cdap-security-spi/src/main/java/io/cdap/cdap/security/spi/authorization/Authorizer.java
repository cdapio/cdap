/**
 * Interface for managing {@link Principal principals'} authorization for {@link Action actions} on
 * {@link EntityId CDAP entities}. Authorization extensions must implement this interface to delegate authorization
 * to appropriate authorization back-ends. The contract with Authorization extensions is as below:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Authorization is enabled setting the parameter {@code security.authorization.enabled} to true in
 *   {@code cdap-site.xml}.</li>
 *   <li>The path to the extension jar bundled with all its dependencies must be specified by
 *   {@code security.authorization.extension.jar.path} in cdap-site.xml</li>
 *   <li>The extension jar must contain a class that implements {@link Authorizer}. This class must be
 *   specified as the {@link Attributes.Name#MAIN_CLASS} in the extension jar's manifest file.</li>
 *   <li>The contract with the class that implements {@link Authorizer} is that it must have a default
 *   constructor.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Authorizer} also provides lifecycle methods for extensions. {@link #initialize(AuthorizationContext)}
 *   can be used to perform initialization tasks. This method provides an {@link AuthorizationContext} which gives
 *   extensions access to CDAP entities for operations like creating and accessing datasets, accessing datasets in
 *   transactions, etc. It also provides access to {@link Properties extension properties} via the
 *   {@link AuthorizationContext#getExtensionProperties()} method. The {@link Properties} object returned form this
 *   method is populated with all configuration settings from {@code cdap-site.xml} that have
 *   keys with the prefix {@code security.authorization.extension.config}.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link #destroy()} method can be used to perform cleanup tasks.</li>
 * </ul>
 * @deprecated Use {@link AccessController}
