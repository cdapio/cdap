/**
 * Class that provides a JVM-singleton schema cache. There are two ways to use it:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If you already has a schema object, you can deduplicate it using {@link #intern(Schema) method}</li>
 *   <li>If you have a schema hash string and schema JSON representation, use {@link #fromJson(String, String)}
 *   method. This would allow you to skip schema deserialization if schema is already in the cache.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>If you have a top schema JSON previously produced by {@link Schema#toString()} you can use
 *   {@link #parseJson(String)} that will compute a hash out of json. Note that you should not use any modified
 *   (e.g. indented) json as a different hash would be computed and cache slot will be wasted. Also you should use it
 *   only for top level schemas for not to pollute cache.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
