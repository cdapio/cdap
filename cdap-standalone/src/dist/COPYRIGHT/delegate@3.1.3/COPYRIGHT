Welcome fellow open source developer. This project is here for you to
link to if you're like me and keep forgetting to include the
MIT-license.txt file.

Fork this project and send a pull request on:

https://github.com/remy/mit-license

By adding a new JSON file to the users directory, it will yield an
MIT License on a CNAME, for example:

{ "copyright": "Remy Sharp, https://remysharp.com" }

Means visiting https://rem.mit-license.org/ shows "Remy Sharp" as the
copyright holder. Namespaces will be on a first come first serve basis,
and I'm open to folk joining the GitHub project.

For more options see the README in the github hosted project.

Hope you find this useful too!

- @rem
