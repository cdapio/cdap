Okio
====

See the [project website][okio] for documentation and APIs.

Okio is a library that complements `java.io` and `java.nio` to make it much
easier to access, store, and process your data. It started as a component of
[OkHttp][1], the capable HTTP client included in Android. It's well-exercised
and ready to solve new problems.
