# Creates a customized Spark image that can be used to run CDAP Spark programs
# This should be run from the CDAP base directory.
# Before creating the image, cdap-spark-core and cdap-kubernetes must be built:
#
# mvn package -P dist -pl cdap-spark-core3_2.12,cdap-kubernetes,cdap-authenticator-ext-gcp -am -DskipTests
#
# Then build the image:
#
# docker build --no-cache --build-arg base_image=<image> \
#   --build-arg cdap_version=`mvn -q -Dexec.executable=echo -Dexec.args='${project.version}' --non-recursive exec:exec` \
#   -f cdap-spark-core3_2.12/src/k8s/Dockerfile \
#   . -t <image>:<tag>
