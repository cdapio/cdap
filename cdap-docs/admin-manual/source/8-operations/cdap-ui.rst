The **CDAP UI** is available for deploying, querying and managing the Cask Data
Application Platform in all modes of CDAP except an 
:ref:`in-memory CDAP <in-memory-data-application-platform>`.

Here is a screen-capture of the CDAP UI running on a Distributed CDAP:

   **CDAP UI:** Showing started-up with applications deployed


Across the top, are three buttons: *Development*, *Operations, and *Management.* These
buttons gives you access to CDAP UI facilities for managing each of the categories.

In the upper-left is a menu for setting the namespace. In the upper-right is a menu
with access to the main Cask Website, Support, and logging out.

On the **Development** page, datasets and applications are displayed. The **Operations** page
gives you views of current system and user metrics, with customizable dashboards. The
**Management** page provides features and controls for administering the CDAP installation.
