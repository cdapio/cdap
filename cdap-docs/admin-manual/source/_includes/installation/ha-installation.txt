Enabling CDAP HA
----------------
In addition to having a :ref:`cluster architecture <admin-manual-install-deployment-architectures-ha>`
that supports HA (high availability), these additional configuration steps need to be followed and completed:

CDAP Components
...............
For each of the CDAP components listed below (Master, Router, Kafka, UI, Authentication Server), these
comments apply:

- Sync the configuration files (such as ``cdap-site.xml`` and ``cdap-security.xml``) on all the nodes. 
- While the default *bind.address* settings (``0.0.0.0``, used for ``app.bind.address``,
  ``data.tx.bind.address``, ``router.bind.address``, and so on) can be synced across hosts,
  if you customize them to a particular IP address, they will |---| as a result |---| be
  different on different hosts.
- Starting services is described in :ref:`|distribution|-starting-services`.

CDAP Master
...........
The CDAP Master service primarily performs coordination tasks and can be scaled for redundancy. The
instances coordinate amongst themselves, electing one as a leader at all times.

- Install the ``cdap-master`` package on different nodes.
- Ensure they are configured identically (``/etc/cdap/conf/cdap-site.xml``). 
- Start the ``cdap-master`` service on each node.

CDAP Router
...........
The CDAP Router service is a stateless API endpoint for CDAP, and simply routes requests to the
appropriate service. It can be scaled horizontally for performance. A load balancer, if
desired, can be placed in front of the nodes running the service.

- Install the ``cdap-gateway`` package on different nodes.
- The ``router.bind.address`` may need to be customized on each box if it is not set to
  the default wildcard address (``0.0.0.0``).
- Start the ``cdap-router`` service on each node.

CDAP Kafka
..........
- Install the ``cdap-kafka`` package on different nodes.
- Two properties need to be set in the ``cdap-site.xml`` files on each node:

  - The **Kafka seed brokers list** is a comma-separated list of hosts, followed by ``/${root.namespace}``:

      ``kafka.seed.brokers``: ``myhost.example.com:9092,.../${root.namespace}``
    
    Substitute appropriate addresses for ``myhost.example.com`` in the above example.
  
  - The **replication factor** is used to replicate Kafka messages across multiple
    machines to prevent data loss in the event of a hardware failure:
  
      ``kafka.default.replication.factor``: 2

- The recommended setting is to run at least two Kafka brokers with a minimum replication
  factor of two; set this property to the maximum number of tolerated machine failures
  plus one (assuming you have that number of machines). For example, if you were running
  five Kafka brokers, and would tolerate two of those failing, you would set the
  replication factor to three. The number of Kafka brokers listed should always be equal to
  or greater than the replication factor.
- Start the ``cdap-kafka`` service on each node.

CDAP UI
.......
- Install the ``cdap-ui`` package on different nodes.
- Start the ``cdap-ui`` service on each node.


CDAP Authentication Server
..........................
- Install the ``cdap-security`` package (the CDAP Authentication Server) on different nodes.
- Start the ``cdap-security`` service on each node.
- Note that when an unauthenticated request is made in a secure HA setup, a list of all
  running authentication endpoints will be returned in the body of the request.
