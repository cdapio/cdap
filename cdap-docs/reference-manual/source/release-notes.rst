2. **Metadata**
    - *Metadata Driven Processing*
       - Annotate metadata to custom entities such as fields in a dataset, partitions of a dataset, files in a fileset
       - Access metadata from a program or plugin at runtime to facilitate metadata driven processing
    - *Field Level Lineage*
       - APIs to register operations being performed on fields from a program or a pipeline plugin
       - Platform feature to compute field level lineage based on operations

3. **Analytics**
    - A simple, interactive, UI-driven approach to machine learning.
    - Lowers the bar for machine learning, allowing users of any level to understand their data and train models
      while preserving the switches and levers that advanced users might want to tweak.

4. **Operational Dashboard**
    - A real-time interactive interface that visualizes program run statistics
    - Reporting for comprehensive insights into program runs over large periods of time

Deprecations
------------
- :cask-issue:`CDAP-8327` - Add property "metrics.processor.queue.size" with default value 20000 to limit the maximum size of a queue where metrics processor temporarily stores newly fetched metrics in memory before persisting them. Added property "metrics.processor.max.delay.ms" with default value 3000 milliseconds to specify the maximum delay allowed between the latest metrics timestamp and the time when it is processed. The larger this property is, Metrics Processor gets to sleep more often between fetching each batch of metrics but the delay between metrics emission and processing also increases. Deprecated the property "metrics.messaging.fetcher.limit"


`Release 4.1.1 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/4.1.1/index.html>`__
=============================================================

Summary
-------

1. **Data Preparation:** Point-and-click interactions and integration with the rest of CDAP
   including |---| but not limited to |---| namespaces, security, and pipelines.

2. **Upgrade:** Significant reduction in downtime during CDAP upgrades, by removing some data
   migration and doing required migration in the background after CDAP starts up.

3. **Pipeline Previews**: Added logs, better error messaging, ability to read from existing
   datasets, and a better stop experience.

4. **Logs**: Added a condensed view of logs for CDAP pipelines and programs that does not
   include logs emitted by the CDAP platform and libraries. The condensed view only
   contains lifecycle logs, logs emitted by the program or pipeline, and errors.

5. **Schedules:** Added the ability to update schedules without redeploying the application.

Known Issues
------------

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-6099` - Due to a limitation in the CDAP MapReduce implementation,
  writing to a dataset does not work in a MapReduce Mapper's ``destroy()`` method.

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-7444` - If a MapReduce program fails during startup, the program's
  ``destroy()`` method is never called, preventing any cleanup or action there being taken.

API Changes
-----------

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-1696` - **Updated the default CDAP Router port to 11015** to avoid
  conflicting with HiveServer2's default port. **Note that this change may cause
  incompatibilities with previous releases if hardcoded in scripts or other programs.**

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-5897` - **Updated the default CDAP UI port to 11011** to avoid
  conflicting with Accumulo and Cloudera Manager's Activity Monitor. **Note that this change
  may cause incompatibilities with previous releases if hardcoded in scripts or other
  programs.**

.. _release-notes-cdap-6837:

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-6837` - Fixed an issue in ``WorkerContext`` that did not properly
  implement the contract of the Transactional interface. **Note that this fix may cause
  incompatibilities with previous releases in certain cases.** See below for details on
  how to handle this change in existing code.

  The Transactional API defines::

    void execute(TxRunnable runnable) throws TransactionFailureException;

  and ``WorkerContext`` implements ``Transactional``. However, it declares this method to
  not throw checked exceptions::

    void execute(TxRunnable runnable);

  That means that any ``TransactionFailureException`` thrown from a
  ``WorkerContext.execute()`` is wrapped into a ``RuntimeException``, and callers must
  write code similar to this to handle the exception::

    try {
      getContext().execute(...);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      if (e.getCause() instanceof TransactionFailureException) {
        // Handle it
      } else {
        // What else to expect? It's not clear...
        throw Throwables.propagate(e);
      }
    }

  This is ugly and inconsistent with other implementations of Transactional. We have
  addressed this by altering the ``WorkerContext`` to directly raise the
  ``TransactionFailureException``. **However, code must change to accomodate this.**

  To address this in existing code, such that it will work both in 4.0.0 and earlier
  versions of CDAP, use code similar to this::

      @Override
      public void run() {
        try {
          getContext().execute(new TxRunnable() {
            @Override
            public void run(DatasetContext context) throws Exception {
              if (getContext().getRuntimeArguments().containsKey("fail")) {
                throw new RuntimeException("fail");
              }
            }
          });
        } catch (Exception e) {
          if (e instanceof TransactionFailureException) {
            LOG.error("transaction failure");
          } else if (e.getCause() instanceof TransactionFailureException) {
            LOG.error("exception with cause transaction failure");
          } else {
            LOG.error("other failure");
          }
        }
      }

  This code will succeed because it handles both the "new style" of the ``WorkerContext``
  directly throwing a ``TransactionFailureException`` and at the same time handle the
  previous style of the ``TransactionFailureException`` being wrapped in a
  ``RuntimeException``.

  Code that is only used in CDAP 4.0.0 and higher can use a simpler version of this::

      @Override
      public void run() {
        try {
          getContext().execute(new TxRunnable() {
            @Override
            public void run(DatasetContext context) throws Exception {
              if (getContext().getRuntimeArguments().containsKey("fail")) {
                throw new RuntimeException("fail");
              }
            }
          });
        } catch (TransactionFailureException e) {
          ...
        }
      }
    }

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-7544` - The `Metadata HTTP RESTful API
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/4.0.0/en/reference-manual/http-restful-api/metadata.html#http-restful-api-metadata-searching>`__
  has been modified to support sorting and
  pagination. To do so, the API now uses additional parameters |---| ``sort``, ``offset``,
  ``limit``, ``numCursors``, and ``cursor`` |---| and the format of the results
  returned when searching has changed. Whereas previous to CDAP 4.0.0 the API returned
  results as a list of results, the API now returns the results as a field in a JSON object.

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-7796` - Two properties are changing in version 4.0.0 of the CSD:

  - ``log.saver.run.memory.megs`` is replaced with ``log.saver.container.memory.mb``

  - ``log.saver.run.num.cores`` is replaced with ``log.saver.container.num.cores``

  Anyone who has modified these properties in previous versions will have to update them
  after upgrading.

Deprecated and Removed Features

  should instead subscribe to the CDAP Audit feed, which contains metadata update
  notifications in messages with audit type ``METADATA_CHANGE``.

`Release 3.5.2 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.5.2/index.html>`__
=============================================================

Known Issues
------------

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-7179` - In CDAP 3.5.0, new ``kafka.server.*`` properties replace older
  properties such as ``kafka.log.dir``, as described in the :ref:`Administration Manual:
  Appendices: cdap-site.xml <appendix-cdap-default-deprecated-properties>`.

  **If you are upgrading from CDAP 3.4.x to 3.5.x** and you have set a value for
  ``kafka.log.dir`` by using Cloudera Manager's :ref:`safety-valve mechanism
  <cloudera-installation-add-service-wizard-configuration>`, you need to change to the new
  property ``kafka.server.log.dirs``, as the deprecated ``kafka.log.dir`` is being ignored
  in favor of the new property. If you don't, your custom value will be replaced with the
  default value.

- :cask-issue:`CDAP-7608` - When running in Standalone CDAP, the Cask Hydrator plugin
  NaiveBayesTrainer has a *permgen* memory leak that leads to an out-of-memory error if

  in the BatchReadableRDD so that it won't skip records when used by
  DataFrame.

Known Issues
------------
- After upgrading CDAP from a pre-3.0 version, any unprocessed metrics data in Kafka will
  be lost and *WARN* log messages will be logged that tell about the inability to process
  old data in the old format.

- `CDAP-797 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-797>`__ -
  When running secure Hadoop clusters, debug logs from MapReduce programs are not
  available.

- `CDAP-1007 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1007>`__ -
  If the Hive Metastore is restarted while the CDAP Explore Service is running, the
  Explore Service remains alive, but becomes unusable. To correct, restart the CDAP Master
  |---| which will restart all services |---| as described under "Starting CDAP Services"
  for your particular Hadoop distribution in the `Installation documentation
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.4.1/en/admin-manual/installation/index.html#installation-index>`__.

- `CDAP-1587 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1587>`__ -
  CDAP internally creates tables in the "user" space that begin with the word
  ``"system"``. User datasets with names starting with ``"system"`` can conflict if they
  were to match one of those names. To avoid this, do not start any datasets with the word
  ``"system"``.

- `CDAP-2632 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2632>`__ -
  The application in the `cdap-kafka-ingest-guide

  does not run on Ubuntu 14.x as of CDAP 3.0.x.

- `CDAP-2721 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2721>`__ -
  Metrics for `FileSets <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.4.1/en/developers-manual/building-blocks/datasets/fileset.html#datasets-fileset>`__
  can show zero values even if there is
  data present, because FileSets do not emit metrics (`CDAP-587
  <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-587>`__).

- `CDAP-2831 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2831>`__ -
  A workflow that is scheduled by time will not be run between the failure of the primary
  master and the time that the secondary takes over. This scheduled run will not be
  triggered at all.

- `CDAP-2920 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2920>`__ - Spark jobs on a
  Kerberos-enabled CDAP cluster cannot run longer than the delegation token expiration.

- `CDAP-2945 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2945>`__ -
  If the input partition filter for a PartitionedFileSet does not match any partitions,
  MapReduce jobs can fail.

- `CDAP-3000 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3000>`__ -
  The Workflow token is in an inconsistent state for nodes in a fork while the nodes of
  the fork are still running. It becomes consistent after the join.

- `CDAP-3221 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3221>`__ -
  When running in Standalone CDAP, if a MapReduce job fails repeatedly, then the SDK
  hits an out-of-memory exception due to ``perm gen``. The Standalone needs restarting at
  this point.

- `CDAP-3262 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3262>`__ -
  For Microsoft Windows, the Standalone CDAP scripts can fail when used with a JAVA_HOME
  that is defined as a path with spaces in it. A workaround is to use a definition of
  JAVA_HOME that does not include spaces, such as ``C:\PROGRA~1\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\bin`` or
  ``C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath``.

- `CDAP-3492 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3492>`__ -
  In the CDAP CLI, executing ``select *`` from a dataset with many fields generates an error.

- `CDAP-3641 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3641>`__ -
  A RESTful API call to retrieve workflow statistics hangs if units (such as "s" for
  seconds) are not provided as part of the query.

- `CDAP-3750 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3750>`__ -
  If a table schema contains a field name that is a reserved word in the Hive DDL, ``'enable explore'`` fails.

- `CDAP-5900 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-5900>`__ - During the
  upgrade to CDAP 3.4.1, publishing to Kafka is halted because the CDAP
  Kafka service is not running. As a consequence, any applications that
  sync to the CDAP metadata will become out-of-sync as changes to the
  metadata made by the upgrade tool will not be published.

  default schema for the specified format if that is available.

- `CDAP-5131 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-5131>`__ - Fixed a problem when filtering
  plugins by their extension plugin type; filtering by the extensions plugin type was

  artifact information for a plugin, the CDAP UI now defaults to the latest artifact from
  the list of artifacts sent by the backend.

- `CDAP-5629 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-5629>`__ - Fixed a problem with losing
  metadata after changing the stream format on a MapR cluster by avoiding the use of Hive

  |---| which will restart all services |---| as described under "Starting CDAP Services"
  for your particular Hadoop distribution in the `Installation documentation
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.4.0/en/admin-manual/installation/index.html#installation-index>`__.

- `CDAP-1587 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1587>`__ -
  CDAP internally creates tables in the "user" space that begin with the word
  ``"system"``. User datasets with names starting with ``"system"`` can conflict if they
  were to match one of those names. To avoid this, do not start any datasets with the word
  ``"system"``.

- `CDAP-2632 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2632>`__ -
  The application in the `cdap-kafka-ingest-guide

  For Microsoft Windows, the Standalone CDAP scripts can fail when used with a JAVA_HOME
  that is defined as a path with spaces in it. A workaround is to use a definition of
  JAVA_HOME that does not include spaces, such as ``C:\PROGRA~1\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\bin`` or
  ``C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath``.

- `CDAP-3492 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3492>`__ -
  In the CDAP CLI, executing ``select *`` from a dataset with many fields generates an error.

- `CDAP-3641 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3641>`__ -
  A RESTful API call to retrieve workflow statistics hangs if units (such as "s" for
  seconds) are not provided as part of the query.

- `CDAP-3750 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3750>`__ -

  FileSet will not attempt to create the directory, it will not delete any files when the
  FileSet is dropped or truncated, and it will not allow adding or deleting files or
  partitions. In other words, the FileSet is read-only.

  for a list of deprecated and removed APIs.


.. _known-issues-310:

Known Issues
------------

- See the above section (*API Changes*) for alterations that can affect existing installations.
- CDAP has been tested on and supports CDH 4.2.x through CDH 5.4.4, HDP 2.0 through 2.6, and
  Apache Bigtop 0.8.0. It has not been tested on more recent versions of CDH.
  See `our Hadoop/HBase Environment configurations
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.1.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#install-hadoop-hbase>`__.
- After upgrading CDAP from a pre-3.0 version, any unprocessed metrics data in Kafka will
  be lost and *WARN* log messages will be logged that tell about the inability to process
  old data in the old format.

- Retrieving multiple metrics |---| by issuing an HTTP POST request with a JSON list as
  the request body that enumerates the name and attributes for each metric |---| is currently not
  supported in the `Metrics HTTP RESTful API v3
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/reference-manual/http-restful-api/http-restful-api-v3/metrics.html#query-tips>`__.
  Instead, use the v2 API. It will be supported in a future release.

- `CDAP-797 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-797>`__ -
  When running secure Hadoop clusters, metrics and debug logs from MapReduce programs are
  not available.

- `CDAP-1007 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1007>`__ -
  If the Hive Metastore is restarted while the CDAP Explore Service is running, the
  Explore Service remains alive, but becomes unusable. To correct, restart the CDAP Master
  |---| which will restart all services |---| as described under "Starting CDAP Services"
  for your particular Hadoop distribution in the `Installation documentation
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#starting-services>`__.

- `CDAP-1587 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1587>`__ -
  CDAP internally creates tables in the "user" space that begin with the word
  ``"system"``. User datasets with names starting with ``"system"`` can conflict if they
  were to match one of those names. To avoid this, do not start any datasets with the word
  ``"system"``.

- `CDAP-1864 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1864>`__ -
  Creating a dataset in a non-existent namespace manifests in the RESTful API with an
  incorrect error message.

- `CDAP-2632 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2632>`__ -
  The application in the `cdap-kafka-ingest-guide
  <https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-kafka-ingest-guide/tree/release/cdap-3.0-compatible>`__
  does not run on Ubuntu 14.x as of CDAP 3.0.x.

- `CDAP-2785 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2785>`__ -
  In the CDAP UI, many buttons will remain in focus after being clicked, even if they
  should not retain focus.

- `CDAP-2831 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2831>`__ -
  A workflow that is scheduled by time will not be run between the failure of the primary
  master and the time that the secondary takes over. This scheduled run will not be
  triggered at all.

- `CDAP-2878 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2878>`__ -
  The semantics for TTL are confusing, in that the Table TTL property is
  interpreted as milliseconds in some contexts: ``DatasetDefinition.confgure()`` and
  ``getAdmin()``.

- `CDAP-2945 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2945>`__ -
  If the input partition filter for a PartitionedFileSet does not match any partitions,
  MapReduce jobs can fail.

- `CDAP-3000 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3000>`__ -
  The Workflow token is in an inconsistent state for nodes in a fork while the nodes of
  the fork are still running. It becomes consistent after the join.

- `CDAP-3101 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3101>`__ -
  If there are more than 30 concurrent runs of a workflow, the runs will not be scheduled
  due to a Quartz exception.

- `CDAP-3179 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3179>`__ -
  If you are using CDH 5.3 (CDAP 3.0.0) and are upgrading to CDH 5.4 (CDAP 3.1.0), you
  must first upgrade the underlying HBase before you upgrade CDAP. This means that you perform the
  CDH upgrade before upgrading the CDAP.

- `CDAP-3189 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3189>`__ -
  Large MapReduce jobs can cause excessive logging in the CDAP logs.

- `CDAP-3221 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3221>`__ -
  When running in Standalone CDAP, if a MapReduce job fails repeatedly, then the SDK
  hits an out-of-memory exception due to ``perm gen``. The Standalone needs restarting at
  this point.


`Release 3.0.3 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.3/index.html>`__
=============================================================

Bug Fix
-------

- Fixed a Bower dependency error in the CDAP UI
  (`CDAP-3010 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-3010>`__).

.. _known-issues-301:

Known Issues
------------

- The application in the `cdap-kafka-ingest-guide
  <https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-kafka-ingest-guide/tree/release/cdap-3.0-compatible>`__
  does not run on Ubuntu 14.x and CDAP 3.0.x
  (`CDAP-2632 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2632>`__,
  `CDAP-2749 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2749>`__).

- Metrics for `TimePartitionedFileSets
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.1/en/developers-manual/building-blocks/datasets/fileset.html#timepartitionedfileset>`__
  can show zero values even if there is data present
  (`CDAP-2721 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2721>`__).

- In the CDAP UI: many buttons will remain in focus after being clicked, even if they
  should not retain focus
  (`CDAP-2785 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2785>`__).

- When the CDAP-Master dies, the CDAP UI does not repsond appropriately, and instead of
  waiting for routing to the secondary master to begin, it loses its connection
  (`CDAP-2830 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2830>`__).

- A workflow that is scheduled by time will not be run between the failure of the primary
  master and the time that the secondary takes over. This scheduled run will not be
  triggered at all. There is no warnings or messages about the missed run of the
  workflow. (`CDAP-2831 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-2831>`__)

- CDAP has been tested on and supports CDH 4.2.x through CDH 5.3.x, HDP 2.0 through 2.1, and
  Apache Bigtop 0.8.0. It has not been tested on more recent versions of CDH.
  See `our Hadoop/HBase Environment configurations
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#install-hadoop-hbase>`__.

- After upgrading CDAP from a pre-3.0 version, any unprocessed metrics data in Kafka will
  be lost and *WARN* log messages will be logged that tell about the inability to process
  old data in the old format.

- See the above section (*API Changes*) for alterations that can affect existing installations.

- When running secure Hadoop clusters, metrics and debug logs from MapReduce programs are
  not available (`CDAP-797 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-797>`__).
- If the Hive Metastore is restarted while the CDAP Explore Service is running, the
  Explore Service remains alive, but becomes unusable. To correct, `restart the CDAP Master
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#starting-services>`__,
  which will restart all services (`CDAP-1007 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1007>`__).
- User datasets with names starting with ``"system"`` can potentially cause conflicts
  (`CDAP-1587 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1587>`__).
- Scaling the number of metrics processor instances doesn't automatically distribute the
  processing load to the newer instances of the metrics processor. The CDAP Master needs to be
  restarted to effectively distribute the processing across all metrics processor instances
  (`CDAP-1853 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1853>`__).
- Creating a dataset in a non-existent namespace manifests in the RESTful API with an
  incorrect error message (`CDAP-1864 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1864>`__).
- Retrieving multiple metrics |---| by issuing an HTTP POST request with a JSON list as
  the request body that enumerates the name and attributes for each metric |---| is currently not
  supported in the
  `Metrics HTTP RESTful API v3 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/reference-manual/http-restful-api/http-restful-api-v3/metrics.html#query-tips>`__.
  Instead, use the v2 API. It will be supported in a future release.
- Typically, datasets are bundled as part of applications. When an application is upgraded and redeployed,
  any changes in datasets will not be redeployed. This is because datasets can be shared across applications,
  and an incompatible schema change can break other applications that are using the dataset.
  A workaround (`CDAP-1253 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1253>`__) is to allow *unchecked dataset upgrades*.
  Upgrades cause the dataset metadata, i.e. its specification including properties, to be updated. The dataset
  runtime code is also updated. To prevent data loss the existing data and the underlying HBase tables remain as-is.

  You can allow *unchecked dataset upgrades* by setting the configuration property ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``
  to ``true`` in ``cdap-site.xml``. This will ensure that datasets are upgraded when the application is redeployed.
  When this configuration is set, the recommended process to deploy an upgraded dataset is to first stop
  all applications that are using the dataset before deploying the new version of the application.
  This lets all containers (flows, services, etc) to pick up the new dataset changes.
  When datasets are upgraded using ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``, no schema compatibility checks are performed by the
  system. Hence it is very important that the developer verify the backward-compatibility, and makes sure that
  other applications that are using the dataset can work with the new changes.

  in a later version of CDAP (`CDAP-1998 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1998>`__). A
  `replacement endpoint
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/reference-manual/http-restful-api/metrics.html#http-restful-api-metrics-querying-a-metric>`__
  is available.

- Metrics: The tag name for service handlers in previous releases was wrongly ``"runnable"``,
  and internally represented as ``"srn"``. These metrics are now tagged as ``"handler"`` (``"hnd"``), and
  metrics queries will only account for this tag name. If you need to query historic metrics
  that were emitted with the old tag ``"runnable"``, use ``"srn"`` to query them (instead of either
  ``"runnable"`` or ``"handler"``).

- The `CDAP CLI <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/reference-manual/cli-api.html#cli>`__
  startup options have been changed to accommodate a new option
  of executing a file containing a series of CLI commands, line-by-line.

- The metrics system APIs have been improved (`CDAP-1596 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1596>`__).

- The rules for `resolving resolution
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/reference-manual/http-restful-api/metrics.html#http-restful-api-metrics-time-range>`__
  when using ``resolution=auto`` in metrics query have been changed
  (`CDAP-1922 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1922>`__).

- Backward incompatible changes in ``InputFormatProvider`` and ``OutputFormatProvider``.
  It won't affect user code that uses ``FileSet`` or ``PartitionedFileSet``.
  It only affects classes who implement the ``InputFormatProvider`` or ``OutputFormatProvider``:

  - ``InputFormatProvider.getInputFormatClass()`` is removed and

    - replaced with ``InputFormatProvider.getInputFormatClassName()``;

  - ``OutputFormatProvider.getOutputFormatClass()`` is removed and

    - replaced with ``OutputFormatProvider.getOutputFormatClassName()``.


Deprecated and Removed Features
-------------------------------

- The `File DropZone <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/developers-manual/ingesting-tools/cdap-file-drop-zone.html>`__
  and `File Tailer <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/developers-manual/ingesting-tools/cdap-file-tailer.html>`__
  are no longer supported as of Release 3.0.
- Support for *procedures* has been removed. After upgrading, an application that
  contained a procedure must be redeployed.
- Support for *service workers* have been removed. After upgrading, an application that
  contained a service worker must be redeployed.
- The old CDAP Console has been deprecated.
- Support for JDK/JRE 1.6 (Java 6) has ended; JDK/JRE 1.7 (Java 7) is
  `now required for CDAP <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#install-java-runtime>`__ or the
  `CDAP SDK <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/developers-manual/getting-started/standalone/index.html#standalone-index>`__.


.. _known-issues-300:

Known Issues
------------

- CDAP has been tested on and supports CDH 4.2.x through CDH 5.3.x, HDP 2.0 through 2.1, and
  Apache Bigtop 0.8.0. It has not been tested on more recent versions of CDH.
  See `our Hadoop/HBase Environment configurations
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#install-hadoop-hbase>`__.

- After upgrading CDAP from a pre-3.0 version, any unprocessed metrics data in Kafka will
  be lost and *WARN* log messages will be logged that tell about the inability to process
  old data in the old format.

- See the above section (*API Changes*) for alterations that can affect existing installations.

- When running secure Hadoop clusters, metrics and debug logs from MapReduce programs are
  not available (`CDAP-797 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-797>`__).
- If the Hive Metastore is restarted while the CDAP Explore Service is running, the
  Explore Service remains alive, but becomes unusable. To correct, `restart the CDAP Master
  <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/3.0.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#starting-services>`__,
  which will restart all services (`CDAP-1007 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1007>`__).
- User datasets with names starting with ``"system"`` can potentially cause conflicts
  (`CDAP-1587 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1587>`__).
- Scaling the number of metrics processor instances doesn't automatically distribute the
  processing load to the newer instances of the metrics processor. The CDAP Master needs to be
  restarted to effectively distribute the processing across all metrics processor instances
  (`CDAP-1853 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1853>`__).
- Creating a dataset in a non-existent namespace manifests in the RESTful API with an
  incorrect error message (`CDAP-1864 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1864>`__).
- Retrieving multiple metrics |---| by issuing an HTTP POST request with a JSON list as
  the request body that enumerates the name and attributes for each metric |---| is currently not
  supported in the
  `Metrics HTTP RESTful API v3 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/reference-manual/http-restful-api/http-restful-api-v3/metrics.html#query-tips>`__.
  Instead, use the v2 API. It will be supported in a future release.
- Typically, datasets are bundled as part of applications. When an application is upgraded and redeployed,
  any changes in datasets will not be redeployed. This is because datasets can be shared across applications,
  and an incompatible schema change can break other applications that are using the dataset.
  A workaround (`CDAP-1253 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1253>`__) is to allow *unchecked dataset upgrades*.
  Upgrades cause the dataset metadata, i.e. its specification including properties, to be updated. The dataset
  runtime code is also updated. To prevent data loss the existing data and the underlying HBase tables remain as-is.

  You can allow *unchecked dataset upgrades* by setting the configuration property ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``
  to ``true`` in ``cdap-site.xml``. This will ensure that datasets are upgraded when the application is redeployed.
  When this configuration is set, the recommended process to deploy an upgraded dataset is to first stop
  all applications that are using the dataset before deploying the new version of the application.
  This lets all containers (flows, services, etc) to pick up the new dataset changes.
  When datasets are upgraded using ``dataset.unchecked.upgrade``, no schema compatibility checks are performed by the
  system. Hence it is very important that the developer verify the backward-compatibility, and makes sure that
  other applications that are using the dataset can work with the new changes.


`Release 2.8.0 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/index.html>`__

    a new program type that can be added to CDAP applications, used to run background
    processes and (beta feature) can write to streams through the WorkerContext.

- **Upgrade and Data Migration Tool**

  - Added an `automated upgrade tool
    <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.8.0/en/admin-manual/installation/installation.html#upgrading-an-existing-version>`__
    which supports upgrading from

- A race condition resulting in a deadlock can occur when a TwillRunnable container
  shutdowns while it still has ZooKeeper events to process. This occasionally surfaces when
  running with OpenJDK or JDK7, though not with Oracle JDK6. It is caused by a change in the
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` implementation between Oracle JDK6 and OpenJDK/JDK7. Until Apache Twill is
  updated in a future version of CDAP, a work-around is to kill the errant process. The YARN
  command to list all running applications and their ``app-id``\s is::

    yarn application -list -appStates RUNNING

  The command to kill a process is::

    yarn application -kill <app-id>

  All versions of CDAP running Apache Twill version 0.4.0 with this configuration can exhibit this

- **Datasets**

  - A new, experimental dataset type to support time-partitioned File sets has been added.
  - Time-partitioned File sets can be queried with Impala on CDH distributions (`CDAP-926 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-926>`__).
  - Streams can be made queryable with Impala by deploying an adapter that periodically
    converts it into partitions of a time-partitioned File set (`CDAP-1129 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1129>`__).
  - Support for different levels of conflict detection: ``ROW``, ``COLUMN``, or ``NONE`` (`CDAP-1016 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1016>`__).

  - Programs are no longer part of a workflow; instead, they are added in the application
    and are referenced by a workflow using their names (`CDAP-1116 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-1116>`__).
  - Schedules are now at the application level and properties can be specified for
    Schedules; these properties will be passed to the scheduled program as runtime

Known Issues
------------

- When running secure Hadoop clusters, metrics and debug logs from MapReduce programs are
  not available (`CDAP-64 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-64>`__ and `CDAP-797
  <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-797>`__).
- When upgrading a cluster from an earlier version of CDAP, warning messages may appear in
  the master log indicating that in-transit (emitted, but not yet processed) metrics
  system messages could not be decoded (*Failed to decode message to MetricsRecord*). This
  is because of a change in the format of emitted metrics, and can result in a small
  amount of metrics data points being lost (`CDAP-745
  <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-745>`__).
- A race condition resulting in a deadlock can occur when a TwillRunnable container
  shutdowns while it still has ZooKeeper events to process. This occasionally surfaces when
  running with OpenJDK or JDK7, though not with Oracle JDK6. It is caused by a change in the
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` implementation between Oracle JDK6 and OpenJDK/JDK7. Until Apache Twill is
  updated in a future version of CDAP, a work-around is to kill the errant process. The YARN
  command to list all running applications and their ``app-id``\s is::

    yarn application -list -appStates RUNNING

  The command to kill a process is::

    yarn application -kill <app-id>

  All versions of CDAP running Apache Twill version 0.4.0 with this configuration can exhibit this
  problem (`TWILL-110 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TWILL-110>`__).


`Release 2.5.2 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.5.2/index.html>`__
=============================================================

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Fixed a problem with a Coopr-provisioned secure cluster failing to start due to a classpath
  issue (`CDAP-478 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-478>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the WISE app zip distribution not packaged correctly; a new version
  (0.2.1) has been released (`CDAP-533 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-533>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the examples and tests incorrectly using the ByteBuffer.array
  method when reading a stream event (`CDAP-549 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-549>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the Authentication Server so that it can now communicate with an LDAP
  instance over SSL (`CDAP-556 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-556>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the program class loader to allow applications to use a different
  version of a library than the one that the CDAP platform uses; for example, a different
  Kafka library (`CDAP-559 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-559>`__).
- Fixed a problem with CDAP master not obtaining new delegation tokens after running for
  ``hbase.auth.key.update.interval`` milliseconds (`CDAP-562 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-562>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the transaction not being rolled back when a user service handler throws an exception
  (`CDAP-607 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-607>`__).

Other Changes
-------------

- Improved the CDAP documentation:

  - Re-organized the documentation into three manuals |---| Developers' Manual, Administration
    Manual, Reference Manual |---| and a set of examples, how-to guides and tutorials;
  - Documents are now in smaller chapters, with numerous updates and revisions;
  - Added a link for downloading an archive of the documentation for offline use;
  - Added links to examples relevant to a particular component;
  - Added suggested deployment architectures for Distributed CDAP installations;
  - Added a glossary;
  - Added navigation aids at the bottom of each page; and
  - Tested and updated the Standalone CDAP examples and their documentation.

Known Issues
------------
- Currently, applications that include Spark or Scala classes in user classes not extended
  from either ``JavaSparkProgram`` or ``ScalaSparkProgram`` (depending upon the language)
  fail with a class loading error. Spark or Scala classes should not be used outside of the
  Spark program. (`CDAP-599 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-599>`__)
- Metrics for MapReduce programs aren't populated on secure Hadoop clusters
- The metric for the number of cores shown in the Resources view of the CDAP Console will be zero
  unless YARN has been configured to enable virtual cores
- Writing to datasets through Hive is not supported in CDH4.x
  (`CDAP-988 <https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/CDAP-988>`__).
- A race condition resulting in a deadlock can occur when a TwillRunnable container

`Release 2.5.1 <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.5.1/index.html>`__
=============================================================

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Improved the documentation of the CDAP authentication and stream clients, both Java and Python APIs.
- Fixed problems with the CDAP Command Line Interface (CLI):

  - Did not work in non-interactive mode;
  - Printed excessive debug log messages;
  - Relative paths did not work as expected; and
  - Failed to execute SQL queries.

- Removed dependencies on SNAPSHOT artifacts for *netty-http* and *auth-clients*.
- Corrected an error in the message printed by the startup script ``cdap sdk``.
- Resolved a problem with the reading of the properties file by the CDAP Flume Client of CDAP Ingest library
  without first checking if authentication was enabled.

Other Changes
-------------

- The scripts ``send-query.sh``, ``access-token.sh`` and ``access-token.bat`` has been replaced by the
  `CDAP Command Line Interface <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/2.5.1/en/api.html#command-line-interface>`__, ``cdap cli``.
- The CDAP Command Line Interface now uses and saves access tokens when connecting to a secure CDAP instance.
- The CDAP Java Stream Client now allows empty String events to be sent.
- The CDAP Python Authentication Client's ``configure()`` method now takes a dictionary rather than a filepath.

Known Issues
------------
- Metrics for MapReduce programs aren't populated on secure Hadoop clusters
- The metric for the number of cores shown in the Resources view of the CDAP Console will be zero
