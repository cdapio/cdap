Release 2.6.0
=============

API Changes
-----------
-  API for specifying Services and MapReduce Jobs has been changed to use a "configurer" 
   style; this will require modification of user classes implementing either MapReduce
   or Service as the interfaces have changed (`CDAP-335

- Fixed a problem with the :ref:`CDAP upgrade tool <install-upgrade>` not preserving—for 
  tables with readless increments enabled—the coprocessor configuration during an upgrade
  (`CDAP-1044 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1044>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the readless increment implementation dropping increment cells when 
  a region flush or compaction occurred (`CDAP-1062 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-1062>`__).

.. _known-issues-260:

Known Issues
------------

- When running secure Hadoop clusters, metrics and debug logs from MapReduce programs are
  not available (`CDAP-64 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-64>`__ and `CDAP-797
  <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-797>`__).
- When upgrading a cluster from an earlier version of CDAP, warning messages may appear in
  the master log indicating that in-transit (emitted, but not yet processed) metrics
  system messages could not be decoded (*Failed to decode message to MetricsRecord*). This
  is because of a change in the format of emitted metrics, and can result in a small
  amount of metrics data points being lost. (`CDAP-745
  <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-745>`__).
- Writing to datasets through Hive is not supported in CDH4.x
  (`CDAP-988 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-988>`__).

Release 2.5.2
=============

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Fixed a problem with a Coopr-provisioned secure cluster failing to start due to a classpath
  issue (`CDAP-478 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-478>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the WISE app zip distribution not packaged correctly; a new version
  (0.2.1) has been released (`CDAP-533 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-533>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the examples and tests incorrectly using the ByteBuffer.array
  method when reading a Stream event (`CDAP-549 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-549>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the Authentication Server so that it can now communicate with an LDAP
  instance over SSL (`CDAP-556 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-556>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the program class loader to allow applications to use a different
  version of a library than the one that the CDAP platform uses; for example, a different
  Kafka library (`CDAP-559 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-559>`__).
- Fixed a problem with CDAP master not obtaining new delegation tokens after running for 
  ``hbase.auth.key.update.interval`` milliseconds (`CDAP-562 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-562>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the transaction not being rolled back when a user service handler throws an exception 
  (`CDAP-607 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-607>`__).

Other Changes
-------------

- Improved the CDAP documentation:

  - Re-organized the documentation into three manuals—Developers' Manual, Administration
    Manual, Reference Manual—and a set of examples, how-to guides and tutorials;
  - Documents are now in smaller chapters, with numerous updates and revisions;
  - Added a link for downloading an archive of the documentation for offline use;
  - Added links to examples relevant to a particular component;
  - Added suggested deployment architectures for Distributed CDAP installations;
  - Added a glossary;
  - Added navigation aids at the bottom of each page; and
  - Tested and updated the Standalone CDAP examples and their documentation.

Known Issues
------------
- Currently, applications that include Spark or Scala classes in user classes not extended
  from either ``JavaSparkProgram`` or ``ScalaSparkProgram`` (depending upon the language)
  fail with a class loading error. Spark or Scala classes should not be used outside of the
  Spark program. (`CDAP-599 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-599>`__)
- See also the *Known Issues* of `version 2.5.0. <#known-issues-250>`_


Release 2.5.1
=============

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Improved the documentation of the CDAP Authentication and Stream Clients, both Java and Python APIs.
- Fixed problems with the CDAP Command Line Interface (CLI):

  - Did not work in non-interactive mode;
  - Printed excessive debug log messages;
  - Relative paths did not work as expected; and 
  - Failed to execute SQL queries.
  
- Removed dependencies on SNAPSHOT artifacts for *netty-http* and *auth-clients*. 
- Corrected an error in the message printed by the startup script ``cdap.sh``.
- Resolved a problem with the reading of the properties file by the CDAP Flume Client of CDAP Ingest library
  without first checking if authentication was enabled.

Other Changes
-------------

- The scripts ``send-query.sh``, ``access-token.sh`` and ``access-token.bat`` has been replaced by the 
  :ref:`CDAP Command Line Interface, <cli>` ``cdap-cli.sh``.
- The CDAP Command Line Interface now uses and saves access tokens when connecting to a secure CDAP instance.
- The CDAP Java Stream Client now allows empty String events to be sent.
- The CDAP Python Authentication Client's ``configure()`` method now takes a dictionary rather than a filepath.

Known Issues
------------
See *Known Issues* of `the previous version. <#known-issues-250>`_
