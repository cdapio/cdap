Metrics HTTP RESTful API
===========================================================

.. highlight:: console

As Applications process data, CDAP collects metrics about the Application’s behavior and
performance. Some of these metrics are the same for every Application—how many events are
processed, how many data operations are performed, etc.—and are thus called **system** or CDAP
metrics.

Other metrics are **user-defined** and differ from Application to Application. 
For details on how to add metrics to your Application, see the section on 
:ref:`User-Defined Metrics <operations-metrics>` in
the :ref:`CDAP Administration Manual. <admin-index>`


Metrics Data
============

Metrics data is identified as a combination of two entities:

- Metrics context
- Metrics name

**Metrics contexts** are hierarchal, rooted in the CDAP instance, and extend through
namespaces, applications, and down to the individual elements.

For example: the metrics context
``namespace.default.app.PurchaseHistory.flow.PurchaseFlow`` is a context that identifies a
Flow. It has a parent context, ``namespace.default.app.PurchaseHistory``, which
identifies the parent application.

Each context is described by a pair, composed of a tag name and a value, such as:

- ``flow.PurchaseFlow`` (tag name: *flow*, value: *PurchaseFlow*)
- ``app.PurchaseHistory`` (tag name: *app*, value: *PurchaseHistory*)
- ``namespace.default`` (tag name: *namespace*, value: *default*)

**Metrics names** are either names generated by CDAP, and pre-pended with ``system``, or 
are names set by a developer when writing an application, which are pre-pended with ``user``.

System metrics vary depending on the context; a list of common system metrics for
different contexts `is available <available-metrics>`_. User metrics are defined by the application
developer and thus are completely dependent on what the developer sets. 

In either case, searches using this API will show, for a given context, all available metrics.


Available Contexts
------------------
The context of a metric is typically enclosed into a hierarchy of contexts. For example,
the Flowlet context is enclosed in the Flow context, which in turn is enclosed in the
Application context. A metric can always be queried (and aggregated) relative to any
enclosing context. These are the available Application contexts of CDAP:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

Available System Metrics
------------------------
For CDAP metrics (system metrics), the available metrics depend on the context.
User-defined metrics are available in the context that they are emitted from.

Note that a user metric may have the same name as a system metric; they are distinguished 
by the prefix.

These metrics are available in a Flowlet context:

     - Read operations performed
   * - ``system.store.writes``
     - Write operations performed


Searches and Queries
====================

The process of retrieving a metric involves these steps:

1. Obtain (usually through a search) the correct context for a metric;
#. Obtain (usually through a search of the context) the available metrics;
#. Querying for a specific metric, supplying the context and any parameters.


Search for Contexts
===================

To search for the available contexts, perform an HTTP request::

  POST <base-url>/v3/metrics/search?target=childContext[&context=<context>]

The optional ``<context>`` defines a metrics context to search within. If it is not
provided, the search is performed across all data. The available contexts that are returned
can be used to query for a lower-level of contexts.

You can also define the query to search in a given context across all values of one or
more tags provided in the context by specifying ``*`` as a value for a tag. See the
examples below for its use.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<context>`` (Optional)
     - Metrics context to search within. If not provided, the search is provided across
       all contexts.

Search for Metrics
==================

To search for the available metrics within a given context, perform an HTTP POST request::

  POST <base-url>/v3/metrics/search?target=metric&context=<context>


.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description

   * - Description
     - Returns all metrics in the context of the application *PurchaseHistory* of the
       *default* namespace; in this case, returns a user-defined metric and a system metric.


Querying A Metric
=================

Once you know the context and the metric to query, you can formulate a request for the
metrics data.

To query a metric within a given context, perform an HTTP GET request::

  POST <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=<context>[&groupBy=<tags>]&metric=<metric>&<time-range>


.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<context>``
     - Metrics context to search within
   * - ``<tags>`` (Optional)
     - Comma-separated :ref:`tag list <http-restful-api-metrics-tag-list>` by which to group 
       results (optional)
   * - ``<metric>``
     - Metric being queried
   * - ``<time-range>``
     - A :ref:`time range <http-restful-api-metrics-time-range>` or ``aggregate=true`` for 
       all since the Application was deployed

.. rubric:: Examples

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=namespace.default.app.HelloWorld.flow.``
       ``WhoFlow.flowlet.saver.system.process.busyness?aggregate=true``
   * - Description
     - Using a *System* metric, *system.process.busyness*
   * - 
     -

     - ``GET <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=namespace.default.app.HelloWorld.flow.``
       ``WhoFlow.runs.13ac3a50-a435-49c8-a752-83b3c1e1b9a8.flowlet.saver.user.names.bytes?aggregate=true``
   * - Description
     - Querying the *User-defined* metric *names.bytes*, of the Flow *saver*, by its run-ID
   * - 
     - 
   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=namespace.default.app.HelloWorld.services``
       ``WhoService.runnables.WhoRun.names.bytes?aggregate=true``
   * - Description
     - Using a *User-defined* metric, *names.bytes* in a Service's Handler


.. rubric:: Comments

For example, to retrieve the number of input data objects (“events”) processed by a Flowlet named *splitter*,
in the Flow *CountRandomFlow* of the Application *CountRandom*, over the last 5 seconds, you can issue an HTTP
POST method::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/flows/CountRandomFlow/flowlets/
          splitter/process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5

This returns a JSON response that has one entry for every second in the requested time interval. It will have
values only for the times where the metric was actually emitted (shown here "pretty-printed")::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  {"start":1382637108,"end":1382637112,"data":[
  {"time":1382637108,"value":6868},
  {"time":1382637109,"value":6895},
  {"time":1382637110,"value":6856},
  {"time":1382637111,"value":6816},
  {"time":1382637112,"value":6765}]}

Each run of a flow is identified by a run-ID. To retrieve the aggregate of events processed by the
run of a flow, you can issue an HTTP GET method::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/flows/CountRandomFlow/runs/13ac3a50-a435-49c8-a752-83b3c1e1b9a8/flowlets/
          splitter/process.events.processed?aggregate=true

If the run-ID is not specified, we aggregate the events processed for all the runs of this flow.

If you want the number of input objects processed across all Flowlets of a Flow, you address the metrics
API at the Flow context::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/flows/
    CountRandomFlow/process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5

Similarly, you can address the context of all flows of an Application, an entire Application, or the entire CDAP::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/
    flows/process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5
  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/
    process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5
  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/process.events?start=now-5s&count=5

To request user-defined metrics instead of system metrics, specify ``user`` instead of ``cdap`` in the URL
and specify the user-defined metric at the end of the request.

For example, to request a user-defined metric for the *HelloWorld* Application's *WhoFlow* Flow::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/user/apps/HelloWorld/flows/
    WhoFlow/flowlets/saver/names.bytes?aggregate=true

To retrieve multiple metrics at once, instead of a GET, issue an HTTP POST, with a JSON
list as the request body that enumerates the name and attributes for each metrics. For
example::

  POST <base-url>/metrics

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

  Content-Type: application/json
  [ "/system/collect.events?aggregate=true",
  "/system/apps/HelloWorld/process.events.processed?start=1380323712&count=6000" ]

If the context of the requested metric or metric itself doesn't exist the system returns
status 200 (OK) with JSON formed as per above description and with values being zeroes.

.. _http-restful-api-metrics-tag-list:

Tag List
--------

In a query, the optional ``groupBy``​parameter defines a list of tags whose values are
used to build multiple timeseries. All data points that have the same values in tags
specified in the ``groupBy`` parameter will form a single timeseries. You define
multiple tags for grouping by providing a comma-separated list.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Tag List
     - Description
   * - ``groupBy=app``
     - Retrieves the time series for each application. 
       For example: ``now-5d-12h`` is 5 days and 12 hours ago.
   * - ``groupBy=app,flow``
     - Retrieves a time series for each app and flow combination

.. _http-restful-api-metrics-time-range:

Time Range
----------
The time range of a metric query can be specified in various ways: either
``aggregate=true`` to retrieve the total aggregated since the Application was deployed, 
or as a ``start`` and ``end`` to define a specific range and return a series of data points.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``aggregate=true``
     - Total aggregated value for the metric since the Application was deployed.
       If the metric is a gauge type, the aggregate will return the latest value set for 
       the metric.
   * - ``start=<time>&end=<time>``
     - Time range defined by start and end times, where the times are either in seconds
       since the start of the Epoch, or a relative time, using ``now`` and times added to it.


With a specific time range, a ``resolution`` can be included to retrieve a series of data
points for a metric. By default, ``resolution=auto``, which means that the resolution will
be determined based on a time difference calculated between the start and end times. If:

- ``(endTime - startTime) >= 3610``, resolution will be in hours; 
- ``(endTime - startTime) >= 610``, resolution will be in minutes; 
- otherwise, resolution will be in seconds.


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Time Range
     - Description
   * - ``start=now-30s&end=now``
     - The last 30 seconds. The start time is given in seconds relative to the current time.
       You can apply simple math, using ``now`` for the current time, 
       ``s`` for seconds, ``m`` for minutes, ``h`` for hours and ``d`` for days. 
       For example: ``now-5d-12h`` is 5 days and 12 hours ago.
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``end=1385629200``
     - From ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT`` to ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:00:00 GMT``,
       both given as since the start of the Epoch
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``count=3600&`` ``resolution=1s``
     - The same as before, the count given as a number of seconds
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``end=1385629200&`` ``resolution=1m``
     - From ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT`` to ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:00:00 GMT``,
       with 1 minute resolution, will return 61 data points with metrics aggregated for each minute.
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``end=1385632800&`` ``resolution=1h``
     - From ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT`` to ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 10:00:00 GMT``,
       with 1 hour resolution, will return 3 data points with metrics aggregated for each hour.

**Comments:**

For example: to return the total number of input objects processed since the
Application *CountRandom* was deployed, assuming that CDAP has not been stopped or
restarted (you cannot specify a time range for aggregates)::

  POST <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=namespace.default.apps.
      CountRandom.system.process.events.processed?aggregate=true

If a metric is a gauge type, the aggregate will return the latest value set for the metric.

For example: this request will retrieve the completion percentage for the map-stage of the MapReduce
``PurchaseHistoryWorkflow_PurchaseHistoryBuilder`` (reformatted to fit)::

  POST <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=namespace.default.app.PurchaseHistory.mapreduce.
      PurchaseHistoryWorkflow_PurchaseHistoryBuilder&metric=system.process.completion&aggregate=true
  

Querying by Run-ID
------------------

Each execution of an program (Flow, MapReduce, Spark, Services, Worker) has an
associated run-ID that uniquely identifies that program's run. We can query metrics for a
program by its run-ID to retrieve the metrics for a particular run. Please see the :ref:`Run
Records and Schedule <rest-program-runs>` on retrieving active and historical program runs.

When querying by ``run-ID``, it is specified in the context after the ``program-id`` with the tag ``run``::

  ...apps.<app-id>.<program-type>.<program-id>.run.<run-id>

Examples (reformatted to fit)::

  POST <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=namespace.default.app.PurchaseHistory.flow.
      MyFlow.run.364-789-1636765&metric=system.process.completion
  
  POST <base-url>/v3/metrics/query?context=namespace.default.app.PurchaseHistory.mapreduce.
      PurchaseHistoryWorkflow_PurchaseHistoryBuilder.run.453-454-447683&metric=system.process.completion
