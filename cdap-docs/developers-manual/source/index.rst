  interactions, and the anatomy of a Big Data application.


.. |building-blocks| replace:: **Building Blocks:**
.. _building-blocks: building-blocks/index.html

- |building-blocks|_ This section covers **the two core abstractions in the Cask Data
  Application Platform: Data and Applications.** Data abstractions include Streams and
  Datasets. Application abstraction is accomplished using Flows, MapReduce, Spark,
  Workflows, and Services. Details are provided on working with these abstractions to
  build Big Data applications.
