Building and Starting
=====================

.. highlight:: console

- You can either build the example (as described in :ref:`Building an Example Application 
  <cdap-building-running-example>`) or use the pre-built JAR file included in the CDAP SDK
  (as described in :ref:`Deploying an Application <cdap-building-running-deploying>`):
  
  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    examples/|example-dir|/target/|example-artifact|-|release|.jar

  
- Start CDAP (as described in :ref:`Starting and Stopping CDAP <start-stop-cdap>`). 

- Deploy the application, as described in :ref:`Deploying an Application <cdap-building-running-deploying>`.
  For example, from the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI) <cli>`:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ cdap-cli.sh load artifact examples/|example-dir|/target/|example-artifact|-|release|.jar
    
    Successfully added artifact with name '|example-artifact|'

    $ cdap-cli.sh create app |example| |example-artifact| |release| user
    
    Successfully created application
  
  
- Once the application has been deployed, you can start its components, as described in
  :ref:`Starting an Application <cdap-building-running-starting-application>`, and detailed at the 
  start of `running the example <#running-the-example>`__.
  
- Once all components are started, `run the example <#running-the-example>`__.

- When finished, you can :ref:`stop <cdap-building-running-stopping>`
  and :ref:`remove the application <cdap-building-running-removing>`.
