Resuming the Schedule
---------------------

The only thing you need to do to start the application is resume the schedule,
as the schedule is in a *suspended* state when the application is deployed.

- Using the CDAP UI, go to the |application-overview|,

  - click |example-workflow-italic| to get to the workflow detail page, 
  - click on the *More* button in the upper-right to display an additional menu, 
  - click on the *Schedules* menu-item to show the schedule, and then 
  - click the *Play* button (**>**) so that the status shows as *scheduled*; or
  
..

- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface:

  .. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ cdap-cli.sh resume schedule |example|.\ |example-schedule|
    
    Successfully resumed schedule '|example-schedule|' in app '|example|'
