How do I build an Analytics Pipeline with Hive, Spark, and CDAP?
----------------------------------------------------------------
We are planning to build an anlytics pipeline with these stages:

- Data Ingestion
- Data Transformation
- Data Analytics

In the Data Transformation stage, we are planning to use the CDAP Explore Service to transform the
data using JOIN, GROUP BY and ORDER BY queries.

We have an analytics pipeline in place, which uses Hive and Spark for processing. Now, we
want to port our pipeline using CDAP.

In Hive, we have queries which perform JOINs on multiple tables, GROUP BY and ORDER BY
queries. We understand that an application can't connect to the Explore Service and make
requests to it. Instead, we are planning to run our queries from outside the application
and once all queries are completed trigger the Spark program.

Are there better ways to use Hive and Spark together with CDAP?


The problem you have is to get the output of the Hive stage into CDAP.
For this, there are a couple of approaches that you can try. The ETL module in CDAP has a
database source which is described with an example:
https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-adapter-guide/tree/develop/DBTableToHBaseTable.
Currently, this has not been tested with Hive, but it would be good to try it out with
Hive JDBC.

You can use this to get data into a CDAP Table. From then on, it becomes a dataset like
any other in CDAP, and can be accessed using Spark.

You can also set up an ETL pipeline (using the CDAP UI) with Hive as a source and a CDAP Table as a
sink. Please see the `DBTableToHBaseTable example 
<https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-adapter-guide/tree/develop/DBTableToHBaseTable>`__
for an example of database-to-CDAP Table. You will need to change the JDBC properties in the example
provided on that page. Alternatively, you can provide all of this information in the
CDAP UI. 


Spark

How do I debug Spark jobs running in CDAP Distributed Mode?
-----------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of ways to solve problems with Spark:

1. First, can you run a simple Spark job on YARN directly? Specifically, submit a Spark
   job using ``spark-submit —master yarn``. The shell script used to launch Spark containers on
   YARN is controlled by ``spark-submit``, not by CDAP. If that is unsuccessful, solving that is
   a pre-requisite to having CDAP working with Spark.

#. If you are seeing an exception such as::

      Exception message:
      /hadoop/yarn/local/usercache/yarn/appcache/application_1438676756737_0070/
      container_e03_1438676756737_0070_02_000005/launch_container.sh: line 26:
      $PWD/cdap-spark.jar/lib/*:...:$PWD/mr-framework/hadoop/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/*:/
      usr/hdp/${hdp.version}/hadoop/lib/hadoop-lzo-0.6.0.${hdp.version}.jar:/etc/hadoop/conf/
      secure:$PWD/__app__.jar:$PWD/*: bad substitution

   The error message can be caused by the ``hdp.version`` property not being set for the
   YARN containers. This can be resolved by adding theses configurations to the
   ``cdap-site.xml`` file (usually located inside ``/etc/cdap/conf/``)::

      <property>
          <name>app.program.jvm.opts</name>
          <value>-Dhdp.version=${hdp.version} -XX:MaxPermSize=128M ${twill.jvm.gc.opts}</value>
          <description>Java options for all program containers</description>
      </property>
    
#. To further debug: when launching a Spark program, CDAP will first launch a YARN
   application to act as the client for submitting the actual Spark job. You can look at the 
   log files from that client container; usually the container-id ends with ``00002``,
   since ``00001`` is the YARN application.
