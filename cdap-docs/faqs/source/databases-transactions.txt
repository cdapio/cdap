Databases
=========

Understand the BufferingTable Undo API 
--------------------------------------
I don't understand the expected behavior of the undo API from BufferingTable.
If the input map contains a null value for a column, does this mean we should 
be deleting that entry for the associated column from the persistent store?

::

  /**
   * Undos previously persisted changes. After this method returns we assume that 
   * data can be visible to other table clients (of course other clients may choose 
   * still not to see it based on transaction isolation logic).
   *
   * @param persisted previously persisted changes. Map is described as row->(column->value).
   *                  Map can contain null values which means that the corresponded column was deleted
   * @throws Exception
   */
  protected abstract void undo(NavigableMap<byte[], NavigableMap<byte[], Update>> persisted)
    throws Exception;


Let's say you have these key-value pairs in your BufferingTable::

  a: 1
  b: 2

Then you deleted ``a`` |---| you would then have::

  b: 2

If you called ``undo()`` with ``{a: null}``, then the expected behavior would be to
"undelete" the ``"a"`` key-value pair which was previously deleted, resulting in the original
state::

  a: 1
  b: 2


Transactions
============

What does the "transaction...is not in progress" message mean?
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you are seeing transaction related errors::

  [warn 2015/08/10 22:50:53.299 IST <DatasetTypeManager STARTING> tid=0x24] Transaction 1231000000 is not in progress.
  co.cask.tephra.TransactionNotInProgressException: canCommit() is called for transaction 1231000000 
  that is not in progress (it is known to be invalid)
    at co.cask.tephra.TransactionManager.commit(TransactionManager.java:842)
    at co.cask.tephra.inmemory.InMemoryTxSystemClient.commit(InMemoryTxSystemClient.java:73)
    at co.cask.tephra.TransactionContext.commit(TransactionContext.java:265)
    ...
	
The message ``(it is known to be invalid)`` indicates that the transaction has timed out.
Transactions normally time out after 30 seconds and then are moved to the "invalid" set.
You can either start a long-running transaction [link] or increase the transaction timeout property [link].


Is the @RoundRobin annotation appropriate for stream events? 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Though the documentation only talks about partitioning when consuming from queues, not
streams, the same partitioning strategies |---| FIFO, round-robin, and hash-based |---|
also apply when used with stream events.

The ``@RoundRobin`` annotation is a property of the **flowlet** and it is applicable
irrespective of who (either a stream or another flowlet) is emitting the data to the
flowlet. When a stream is connected to a flowlet, the stream acts as a source which is
basically a file-backed queue. Based on the partitioning strategy specified for the
flowlet, an appropriate instance of the flowlet consumes the event from the queue.
