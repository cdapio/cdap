Core Datasets
============================================

**Tables** are the only core Datasets, and all other Datasets are built using one or more
Tables. These Tables are similar to tables in a relational database with a few key differences:

- Tables have no fixed schema. Unlike relational database tables where every
  row has the same schema, every row of a Table can have a different set of columns.

- Because the set of columns is not known ahead of time, the columns of
  a row do not have a rich type. All column values are byte arrays and
  it is up to the application to convert them to and from rich types.
  The column names and the row key are also byte arrays.

- When reading from a Table, one need not know the names of the columns:
  The read operation returns a map from column name to column value.
  It is, however, possible to specify exactly which columns to read.

- Tables are organized in a way that the columns of a row can be read
  and written independently of other columns, and columns are ordered
  in byte-lexicographic order. They are also known as *Ordered Columnar Tables*.
