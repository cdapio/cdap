Configuring and Installing CDAP using Cloudera Manager
======================================================


Overview
=======================================

You can use `Cloudera Manager
<http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cloudera-enterprise/cloudera-manager.html>`__ 
to integrate CDAP into a Hadoop cluster by downloading and installing a CDAP CSD (Custom
Service Descriptor). Once the CSD is installed, you will able to use Cloudera Manager to
install, start and manage CDAP on Hadoop clusters.

These instructions cover the steps to integrate CDAP using Cloudera Manager:

- **Prerequisites:** Preparing your Hadoop cluster for CDAP.
- **Download:** Downloading the CSD file.
- **Install, Setup, and Startup:** Installing the CSD, running the *Add Service* Wizard, and starting CDAP.
- **Verification:** Confirming that CDAP was installed and configured successfully.
- **Troubleshooting:** Particular situations that can occur with Cloudera.


Roles and Dependencies
----------------------
The CDAP CSD consists of four mandatory roles:

- Master
- Gateway/Router
- Kafka-Server
- Web-App

and an optional role—Security Auth Service—plus a Gateway client configuration. 

CDAP depends on HBase, YARN, HDFS, Zookeeper, and—optionally—Hive. All services run as
the 'cdap' user installed by the parcel.


Prerequisites
=======================================

#. Node.js (version 0.8.16 or greater) must be installed on the node(s) where the Web-App
   role instance will run. You can download the latest version of Node.js from `nodejs.org
   <http://nodejs.org>`__.

#. Zookeeper's ``maxClientCnxns`` must be raised from its default.  We suggest setting it to zero
   (unlimited connections). As each YARN container launched by CDAP makes a connection to Zookeeper, 
   the number of connections required is a function of usage.

#. For Kerberos-enabled Hadoop clusters:

   - The 'cdap' user needs to be granted Hbase permissions to create tables.
     In an Hbase shell, enter::
     
      grant 'cdap', 'ACRW'

   - The 'cdap' user must be able to launch YARN containers, either by adding it to the YARN
     ``allowed.system.users`` or by adjusting ``min.user.id``.

#. Ensure YARN is configured properly to run MapReduce programs.  Often, this includes
   ensuring that the HDFS ``/user/yarn`` directory exists with proper permissions.

#. Ensure that YARN has sufficient memory capacity by lowering the default minimum container 
   size. Lack of YARN memory capacity is the leading cause of apparent failures that we
   see reported.

Download
=======================================

Download the CDAP CSD (Custom Service Descriptor): `download JAR file <http://cask.co/resources/#cdap-integrations>`__.

Details on CSDs and Cloudera Manager Extensions are `available online 
<https://github.com/cloudera/cm_ext/wiki>`__.


Install, Setup, and Startup
=======================================

.. rubric:: Install the CSD

#. `Install the CSD <http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/latest/topics/cm_mc_addon_services.html>`__.
#. Download and distribute the CDAP-<version> parcel.

.. rubric:: Setup using the Cloudera Manager Admin Console *Add Service* Wizard

Run the Cloudera Manager Admin Console *Add Service* Wizard and select *CDAP*.
When completing the Wizard, these notes may help:

   - *Add Service* Wizard, Page 2: **Optional Hive dependency** is for the optional CDAP
     "Explore" component which can be enabled later.
     
   - *Add Service* Wizard, Page 3: CDAP **Security Auth** Service is an optional service
     for CDAP perimeter security; it can be configured and enabled post-wizard.
     
   - *Add Service* Wizard, Page 5: **Kerberos Auth Enabled** is needed if running against a
     secure Hadoop cluster.

   - *Add Service* Wizard, Page 5: **Router Server Port:** This should match the "Router Bind
     Port"; it’s used by the CDAP Console to connect to the Router service.

Verification
=======================================

After CDAP has started up, the best way to verify the installation is to deploy an application,
ingest some data, run a MapReduce program on it, and then query the results out.  The following
procedure describes how to do this primarily, via the CDAP Console, though this can all be done via
command line.

We provide in our SDK pre-built ``.JAR`` files for convenience.

#. Download and install the latest `CDAP Software Development Kit (SDK)
   <http://cask.co/downloads/#cdap>`__. The version should match the version you have installed.
#. Extract to a folder (``CDAP_HOME``).
#. Open a command prompt and navigate to ``CDAP_HOME/examples``.
#. Each example folder has a ``.jar`` file in its ``target`` directory.
   For verification, we'll use the ``Purchase`` example and its jar, located in 
   ``CDAP_HOME/examples/Purchase-<version>.jar``. The ``Purchase`` example is documented 
   in the CDAP :ref:`examples manual <examples-purchase>`.

#. Open a web browser to the CDAP Console. It is located on port ``9999`` of the box where
   you installed CDAP.

#. From the CDAP Console Overview page, click "Load App” and navigate to the jar.
   (You can also drag-and-drop to the browser window)

#. Once it is deployed, click on the *Process* button in the left sidebar of the CDAP Console,
   then click *PurchaseFlow* in the Process page to get to the *Flow* detail page, then
   click the *Start* button. (This will launch additional YARN containers.)

#. Once the Flow is *RUNNING*, inject data by clicking on the *purchaseStream* icon in
   the Flow diagram.  In the dialog that pops up, type "Tom bought 5 apples for $3" and click
   *Inject*.  You should see activity in the graphs and the Flowlet counters increment.

#. Run a MapReduce program against this data by click on the *Process* button in the left
   sidebar of the CDAP Console, select *PurchaseHistoryWorkflow_PurchaseHistoryBuilder*,
   and click the *Start* button.  This will launch an additional container and a MapReduce
   job in YARN.  After it starts you should see the Map and Reduce progress bars complete.
   Failures at this stage are often due to YARN MapReduce misconfiguration or a lack of
   YARN capacity.

#. After the MapReduce job is complete, we can startup a query service which will read
   from the processed dataset.  Navigate to Application -> PurchaseHistory ->
   PurchaseHistoryService (under the “Service” section).  Click the Start button to start
   the Service.  (This will launch another YARN container)

#. Send an HTTP RESTful API request to the Gateway/Router service to read back the data you injected. 
   The API listens on the host where the Gateway/Router role instance is running, port
   11015 by default (though you may have changed it in the Wizard).  Make a ``curl`` request::

     curl -w'\n' -v \
       'http://[router-host]:[router-port]/v3/namespaces/default/apps/PurchaseHistory/services/PurchaseHistoryService/methods/history/Tom'

#. You should get back a response similar to::

     {"customer":"Tom","purchases":[{"customer":"Tom","product":"apple","quantity":5,"price":3,
      "purchaseTime":1421470224780,"catalogId":""}]}

#. You have now completed verification of the installation.


Troubleshooting
=======================================

Some versions of Hive may try to create a temporary staging directory at the table
location when executing queries. If you are seeing permissions errors when running a
query, try setting ``hive.exec.stagingdir`` in your Hive configuration to
``/tmp/hive-staging``. 

This can be done in Cloudera Manager using the "Hive Client
Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hive-site.xml" configuration field.
